/**
 * Ambient types for the JSCAD v3 alpha packages, covering only what this site uses.
 *
 * Both packages set a package.json "exports" map with no "types" condition, so
 * TypeScript cannot see their shipped declarations at all. In @jscad/modeling's case
 * that is just as well: as of 3.0.7-alpha.0 its index.d.ts still describes the v2
 * namespaced API (`primitives.cuboid`) rather than the flattened v3 exports.
 *
 * This file must stay script-style — no top-level import or export — or the ambient
 * module declarations below stop being ambient.
